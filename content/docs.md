### Overview

Pear is a static site generator written in the [Raku](https://raku.org)
programming language. It uses [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) to
do its templating. Put briefly, Pear takes a bunch of Markdown documents
under certain directory and generate the HTML for a site.

### Where to start?

If you're looking to get up and running quickly, give the
[quickstart guide](https://uzluisf.github.io/pear-doc/docs/) a read. Otherwise,
if you're familiar with static site generators in general, the
other documentation pages may be a better jumping off point for you.
