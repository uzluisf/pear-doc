Pear
====

Pear is a simple static site generator written in [Raku](https://raku.org/). It uses [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) for its templating.

**NOTE**: `MODDOC.md` is generated from `doc/Pear.rakudoc` with `raku --doc=Markdown doc/Pear.rakudoc > MODDOC.md`. Any update to the module's documentation should be made to `doc/Pear.rakudoc`.

Installation
============

From source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hunter-classes/winter-2020-codefest-submissions-phoebe.git
    $ cd winter-2020-codefest-submissions-phoebe
    $ zef install .

Requirements and dependencies
=============================

First of all, the [Rakudo compiler](https://rakudo.org/) must be installed on the machine. As for dependencies, Pear depends on the following modules:

  * [`Template::Mustache`](https://github.com/softmoth/p6-Template-Mustache) for parsing the Mustache templates.

  * [`Text::Markdown`](https://github.com/softmoth/p6-Template-Mustache) to generate HTML from Markdown.

  * [`YAMLish`](https://github.com/Leont/yamlish) for parsing the YAML configuration file.

  * [`Log`](https://github.com/whity/perl6-log) for logging messages while Pear is running.

  * [`HTTP::Server::Tiny`](https://github.com/tokuhirom/p6-HTTP-Server-Tiny) for the server functionality.

If not installed, all these modules will be installed automatically by `zef` during the installation of Pear. They can all be found in the Raku ecosystem at [https://modules.raku.org/](https://modules.raku.org/)

Example
=======

You can find the source files for a sample website at https://github.com/uzluisf/pear-demo which can be found live at https://uzluisf.github.io/pear-demo/.

To generate the HTML for the website yourself, download the repo and then follow these commands:

    $ cd pear-demo/
    $ pear render

To serve the rendered site:

    $ pear serve

To live preview it while it's rendered upon changes:

    $ pear watch

Configuration
=============

The configuration for a site is controlled by the YAML file in the site's root directory. By default, it's named `config.yaml` but a new configuration file can be provided with the option `--config-name` when running `pear`.

    title: Site's title

    directories:
      templates: templates
      include:   static
      posts:     blog
      output:    public

Everything in the configuration file will be provided to the templates in the global variable `site`, except `directories`. For instance, the site's title would be available as `site.title`.

Global variables
================

**Note:** Most variables made available have more attributes than the ones mentioned below but they aren't necessarily useful to a template.

The following variables are made available to the templates:

  * `site`, user defined variables from the configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`). By default, `site` includes the following variables:

    * `include`, list of directories under the directory for static files specified in the YAML configuration file. Note that this is always `include` regardless of what it's specified in the configuration file.

    * `time`, the time at the moment `pear` is executed in the site's root directory.

  * `page`, information about a page (e.g., `page.title`). A post and a tag outside the global variables `posts` and `tags` respectively are considered regular pages. Thus, this means a page might contain more attributes than the ones mentioned below (See `post` and `tag` for their own respective attributes):

    * `content`, the post's HTML content.

  * `posts`, list of all the blog posts.

  * `tags`, list of tags from the blog posts.

Other variables
---------------

The following variables are accessible via global variables:

  * `post`, information about a given post and only accessible when iterating over the global variable `posts`. A post contains the following attributes:

    * `content`, the post's HTML content (e.g., `<h2>Say's Phoebe</h2>`).

    * `url`, the post's url (e.g., `09/23/2019/dark-secondaries`).

    * `id`, the post's identifier (same as `url`).

    * `next`, the next post from current post.

    * `previous`, the previous post from current post.

    * `tags`, the tags. See `tag` for the attributes a tag holds.

    * `template`, the template with which the post is rendered. Note that each post must specify a template.

    * `date`, the post's date. Its format must be `yyyy-mm-dd`. Nonetheless, you can change its formatting by specifying the preferred format. The date format is based on `strftime`'s directives; there's a reference for it at https://strftime.org/ and for live preview at http://www.strftime.net/. For date in the page's metadata, there are the following options:

      * `date: 2019-12-25`, if not format specified in the the configuration file (with `date-format`), then the default format `%b %d, %Y` will be used.

      * `date: [2019-12-25, %Y/%m/%d]`, format date according to given format.

    * `draft`, is the post a draft? If set to `true`, the post won't appear in the generated HTML for the site.

All the other attributes in a post's metadata will be included alongside the attributes discussed earlier. However, Pear won't mess with them. For instance, you can have `title: tHiS iS a TitlE` and `tHiS iS a TitlE` will be the post's title.

  * `tag`, information about a tag and only accessible when iterating over the global variable `tags`. A tag contains the following attributes:

    * `name`, the tag's name (e.g, `linux`).

    * `url`, the tag's url (e.g., `/tag/linux`).

    * `posts`, the list of posts using that tag.
