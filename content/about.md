### Site

This is a static site generated with Pear. The source for both the raw files
(`source` branch) and the site's HTML (`master` branch) is stored in
[Github](https://github.com/uzluisf/pear-doc). The site is build using a Bash
script that renders the site (using `pear render`) from the `source` branch
and pushes the generated HTML to the `master` branch.

The theme is based on a [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-whisper-theme/).
